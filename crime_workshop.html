        <h1>Crime Data Workshop</h1>
        <p>
            This workshop introduces officers to modern data tools used in crime analysis. Learn how to interpret trends, spot criminal patterns, and use predictive policing tools to improve response strategies.

        <p>
            Participants will engage in live demos, case studies, and hands-on sessions with data dashboards. By the end, officers will be equipped to make data-informed decisions for crime prevention.
The workshop will be held online via Google Meet, starting from August 12, 2025, with daily sessions from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The access link will be shared one day prior to the workshop through email.

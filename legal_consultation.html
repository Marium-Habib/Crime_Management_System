        <h1>Legal Consultation for Officers</h1>
        <p>
            Legal consultation services are provided to help officers navigate complex legal procedures while handling criminal cases. These services offer guidance on warrant procedures, rights of the accused, evidence admissibility, and legal documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Officers can schedule one-on-one sessions with legal advisors to ensure their actions are compliant with judicial standards and prevent procedural errors that could compromise cases.
These consultations will be conducted online via Google Meet, and officers can book appointments through the official training portal. Appointment confirmations and meeting links will be sent via email.

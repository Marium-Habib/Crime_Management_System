        <p>
            Our comprehensive investigation training program is designed for law enforcement officers to enhance their skills in evidence collection, interrogation, digital forensics, and report writing. This program includes both online modules and practical sessions supervised by experts.

        <p>
            The training will be conducted online via Google Meet, starting from August 5, 2025. The meeting link will be shared one day before the training begins. Officers are encouraged to regularly update their investigative techniques to stay ahead of evolving criminal tactics. The training also emphasizes ethics, legal boundaries, and inter-agency cooperation.
